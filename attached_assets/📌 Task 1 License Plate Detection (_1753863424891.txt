ðŸ“Œ Task 1: License Plate Detection (Without Deep Learning)
ðŸ§¾ Problem:
You are given an input image (input.jpg) containing one or more vehicles. Your goal is to detect
license plate-like regions using only classical image processing (no pretrained models like
YOLO, Haar, or OpenCV classifiers).
âœ… Requirements:
1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Extract regions that are likely to be license plates:
a. Rectangular
b. High-contrast edges
c. Aspect ratio between 2:1 and 5:1
3. Draw bounding boxes around such regions.
4. Save the output image as output.jpg.
ðŸ”§ Constraints:
1. Do not use any pretrained model.
2. Use only standard image processing libraries: OpenCV, NumPy.
3. Code must be modular and readable.
ðŸ“‚ Input:
input.jpg
ðŸ“‚ Output:
output.jpg (result with bounding boxes)
